# DECODE
Algorithm for DEtection and Characterization of cOastal tiDal wEtlands change (DECODE) using Landsat time series. It can changes in coastal tidal wetlands: providing accurate land cover and land change maps for costal tidal wetland areas fully automated at high spatial resolution (30-meter) for large areas.

**Dataset** are available at [this Mendeley Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/5dz3c5tfw9.2) to download the status of coastal tidal wetlands in the northeastern United States from 1986 to 2020.

**Interactive maps** are available at [GEE APP for change maps](https://gers.users.earthengine.app/view/decodechange) and [GEE APP for cover maps](https://gers.users.earthengine.app/view/decodecover).
