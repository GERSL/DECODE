# DECODE
Algorithm for DEtection and Characterization of cOastal tiDal wEtlands change (DECODE) using Landsat time series. It can changes in coastal tidal wetlands: providing accurate land cover and land change maps for costal tidal wetland areas fully automated at high spatial resolution (30-meter) for large areas.

**Dataset** are available at [this Mendeley Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/5dz3c5tfw9.1) to download the status of coastal tidal wetlands in the northeastern United States from 1986 to 2020.

**Interactive maps** are available at [GEE APP for change maps](https://gers.users.earthengine.app/view/decodechange) and [GEE APP for cover maps](https://gers.users.earthengine.app/view/decodecover).

Our paper entitled "Detection and characterization of coastal tidal wetland change in the northeastern US using Landsat time series" is submitted to RSE and the codes will be released in public after the publication of the paper.
