# DECODE (Updated on Jan. 25, 2024)
Algorithm for DEtection and Characterization of cOastal tiDal wEtlands change (DECODE) using Landsat time series. It can changes in coastal tidal wetlands: providing accurate land cover and land change maps for costal tidal wetland areas fully automated at high spatial resolution (30-meter) for large areas. 

**DECODE v2** An updated version was applied to monitor the tidal wetland (tidal marsh, mangrove, mangrove diebacks, and tidal flats) changes in the conterminous US from 1986 to 2020. Please follow up with "HowToRunDECODE.m" by using the Associated Test data in a local computer or High-Performance Computing (HPC) platform. Note: HPC is highly recommended to run DECODE. 

**Associated Test data (~13000 Landsat pixels in Florida) are available to download** [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EmOLwQ4Do8LgHNfZK3Zcm8CPXOBHJbCQ/view?usp=drive_link). 

Please contact Xiucheng Yang (xiucheng.yang@uconn.edu) and Zhe Zhu (zhe@uconn.edu) at the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, University of Connecticut if you have any questions.

**Interactive maps (v2)** are available at [GEE APP for tidal wetlands in the US](https://gers.users.earthengine.app/view/tidalwetlandcover) with the link to download the US product from GEE.
